This repository contains the train and test code for the paper _[Temporally-Aware Feature Pooling for Action Spotting in Video Broadcasts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06779.pdf)_.

This is an extended codebase for soccer event spotting on _[SoccerNet_v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13367.pdf)_, which contains 17 classes (the original masking strategy presented in the RMS-Net paper has not been tested yet on the extended set of classes).
